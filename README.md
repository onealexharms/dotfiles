# Dotfiles
This is a place to keep config files and other things that have to be set up, for example on a new computer.

`./script/make-symlinks` creates symlinks from the paths under dotfiles.

Here's the file structure for the repo:
`dotfiles/human-readable-tag/maybe-directory/something.symlink/more-stuff`

All the stuff that's supposed to be in .maybe-directory/something is here in dotfiles/
And whatever is supposed to be at .maybe-directory/something/more-stuff is also here.
